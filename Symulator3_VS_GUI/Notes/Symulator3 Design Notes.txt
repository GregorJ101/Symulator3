Design Notes

Status 2020-02-08
- Changing color of specific text: TextBlocks and RichTextBoxes only
- Adding lines with defined newlines: TextBlocks and TextBoxes (RTB either no line breaks or double-spaced lines)
- Scrollbars only on TextBlocks and RichTextBoxes
- Scrolling hidden text into view programatically in TextBoxes only

- TextBlock is not a true Control, just a FrameworkElement

Windows to populate
- Database tree
  > Card Data
  > Card Object IPL
  > Card Object Text
  > Disk Created Images
  > Disk Original Images
  > File Master
  > File Tokens
  > Saved Scripts
  > Script Macros
- DASM
- Trace
- Script (highlight strp/command currently running)
- Program output: printed
- Program output: MFCU punch (stackers 1 - 4)
- Program output: MFCU print (stackers 1 - 4)
- Registers (CPU & I/O)
- HALT (showing actual bits mapped to segments
- 5475 column indicators (showing actual bits mapped to segments
- Breakpoint list (by hex IAR address)
- Memory watch by specific addresses
- Changed memory (automatically update address with each instruction that changes memory (MVC, ALC, ...; data read from card or disk)

GUI items to implement:
  [x] Fixed menu bar
  [-] Relocatable toolbar (like in Visual Studio, Sound Forge, ...)
  [x] StatusBar
  [-] Ribbon control (?)
  [x] WPF Commands

Menu options
- File
  > Load program / data file / script file on disk
  > Load program / data file / script file from database
  > Add/update program / data file / script file to database
  > Dump / disassemble program / data file from file / database
- Disassembly settings (all available internal flags)
- Trace settings (all available internal flags)
- Simulate System/3 CPU speed
- Debug
  > Set / suspend / remove breakpoints
  > Run uninterrupted
  > Run to breakpoint
  > Run to cursor
  > Step instruction

Script language
